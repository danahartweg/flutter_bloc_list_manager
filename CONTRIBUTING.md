## Writing changelog entries

This package is automatically published on a merge to the `main` branch. If the package version has been bumped:

+ The changelog will be parsed for the latest entry
+ A GitHub release will be created
+ The package will be published to pub.dev

Changelog entries should be written according to the [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format. There is a PR check to ensure a changelog entry has been added in the correct format.
